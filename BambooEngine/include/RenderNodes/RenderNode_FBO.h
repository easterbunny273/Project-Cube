  This SceneObject is not a real SceneObject as an object in the scene,
  rather it's an object which can be used in the sceneobjects-tree to render all
  children in a fbo.
  This object renders all children in a fbo and registers the created textures in the TextureManager,
  which means that the resulting textures can simply used by TextureManager::useTexture(...).
  The name for the textures must be set in the used constructor.
